# ICT & Cybersecurity Technical Labs
Welcome to my technical portfolio. This repository serves as a documented record of my hands-on experience in network architecture, security auditing, and ICT infrastructure management.

## Featured Project: Inter-VLAN Routing & Security Configuration
This lab demonstrates the implementation of a secure, segmented network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

###  Project Objectives
* Implement **Inter-VLAN routing** using the Router-on-a-Stick method.
* Enhance network security through **Port Security** and **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**.
* Configure secure remote management via **SSH** instead of Telnet.

###  Technologies Used
* **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Network Simulation)
* **Protocols:** VTP, STP, IEEE 802.1Q, OSPF
* **Security:** MAC Address Filtering, DHCP Snooping

###  Key Features
1. **Network Segmentation:** Created distinct VLANs for HR, Finance, and IT to minimize the blast radius of potential internal threats.
2. **Hardened Management:** Disabled unused ports and moved them to a "Blackhole" VLAN.
3. **Redundancy:** Configured Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent switching loops while maintaining uptime.
